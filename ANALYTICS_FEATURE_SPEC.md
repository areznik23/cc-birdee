# Claude Code User Analytics Feature Specification

## Overview
Build a comprehensive analytics system to analyze Claude Code sessions and provide actionable insights about user coding patterns, strengths, and areas for improvement.

## Core Functionality
- Index all Claude Code sessions to identify user patterns:
  - Technical strengths and weaknesses
  - Coding tendencies and preferences
  - Common problem-solving approaches
  - Language and framework proficiency
  - Code quality patterns

## Architecture

### 1. Background Pipeline
- **Session Processing**: Process each conversation individually through o3 model
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract detailed feedback and metrics per session
- **Data Aggregation**: Merge all feedback into a unified analysis
- **Storage**: Persist processed insights for quick retrieval

### 2. Main Analytics Panel
- **User Profile Overview**: Top-level breakdown of user capabilities
- **Insight Categories**:
  - Technical proficiency by language/framework
  - Code quality metrics and trends
  - Problem-solving patterns
  - Common errors and how they're resolved
- **Evidence-Based Insights**: Specific code examples demonstrating each insight
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improvement
- **Progress Tracking**: Historical view of skill development

## Quality Standards
- **Target Audience**: Distinguished engineers
- **Code Quality Requirements**:
  - Clean, minimal codebase with clear intent
  - Strong separation of concerns
  - Well-documented interfaces and APIs
  - No unnecessary complexity or over-engineering
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Performance-conscious implementation

## Design Principles
1. **Lean Feature Design**: Only essential functionality, no feature bloat
2. **Single Responsibility**: Every component has one clear purpose
3. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Prioritize readable code over clever optimizations
4. **Data Privacy**: Ensure all analytics respect user privacy
5. **Extensibility**: Design for future enhancement without major refactoring

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Claude Code conversation logs
2. **Processing**: Background worker processes conversations through o3
3. **Storage**: Indexed insights in efficient data structure
4. **Retrieval**: Fast query interface for analytics panel
5. **Presentation**: Clean, intuitive UI for insights

### Key Components
- **Session Parser**: Extracts relevant data from conversations
- **Analytics Engine**: Processes sessions through o3 for insights
- **Data Aggregator**: Combines individual session insights
- **Storage Layer**: Efficient persistence and retrieval
- **API Layer**: Clean interface for frontend consumption
- **UI Components**: Modular, reusable visualization components

### Performance Considerations
