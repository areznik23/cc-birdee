# Supabase Design Library Implementation

The "Save to Supabase" button exists but needs implementation. Create a design library system:

## Database Schema

1. Create designs table with:
   ```sql
   - id, created_at, optical_json, design_name
   - customer_name (for your quantum/biotech/lidar/semiconductor customers)  
   - application_type 
   - status (draft/validated/ordered)
   - performance_metrics (extracted from optical calculations)
   - total_cost, component_count
   ```

2. When clicking "Save to Supabase":
   - Modal appears with fields for design name and customer info
   - Auto-extract performance metrics from the optical JSON
   - Save with timestamp

3. Add "Load Design" functionality:
   - List saved designs with filtering
   - Search by design name or component types
   - Preview key specifications
   - One-click load back into the chat interface

4. Test with various optical designs:
   - Your standard beam expander configurations
   - Interferometer designs you've been validating
   - Fiber coupling systems

This becomes your reusable design library for customer demonstrations.

## Integration Notes
- Use your existing Supabase connection (SUPABASE_URL already in env)
- Leverage the optical system JSON structure from your generator tool
- Consider adding version tracking for design iterations
