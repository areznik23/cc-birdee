# Customer Demo Presentation Mode

Create a clean presentation view for live customer demos. Add a "Demo Mode" toggle that:

## UI Simplification

1. Hide technical elements:
   - Remove console logs and debug information
   - Simplify or hide technical buttons when appropriate
   - Clean up error messages to be customer-friendly
   - Focus on the optical design results

2. Add customer-facing features:
   - Clean, professional interface
   - "Share Design" functionality
   - Fullscreen mode for Unity viewer when implemented
   - Export capabilities for customer records

3. Demo flow optimization:
   - Streamlined prompting: "What optical system do you need?"
   - Generate design variations (different price/performance points)
   - Comparison view for multiple options
   - Easy export/sharing of results

4. Pre-configured demonstrations:
   - Beam expander designs (various expansion ratios)
   - Interferometer configurations
   - Fiber coupling systems
   - Other optical systems relevant to your customer base

Test by running mock demonstrations for each target industry.

## Purpose
As a founder selling to enterprises (quantum computing, biotech, LiDAR, semiconductors), you need a professional interface that focuses on the optical design results rather than implementation details.
