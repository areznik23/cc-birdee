# Adam's Tactical Prompts for Next Week

These prompts are based on your recent development trajectory and current state:

## Context
- You just completed the JSON viewer UI with Unity/Supabase buttons visible
- You're building Photonium for quantum computing, biotech, LiDAR, and semiconductor customers
- You consistently test with beam expanders, interferometers, and fiber optics
- Your stack: Next.js + Vercel, S3 component database (Thorlabs/Edmund), custom physics calculations

## Prompt Sequence
1. **Unity WebGL Viewer** - Make the "Render in Unity" button functional
2. **Supabase Design Library** - Implement the "Save to Supabase" functionality  
3. **Customer Demo Mode** - Create professional presentation interface
4. **Batch Variations** - Generate multiple design options automatically

Each prompt builds on the previous one, moving from backend implementation to customer-facing features.

## Usage
Copy each prompt directly into Claude Code when you're ready to implement that feature. The prompts assume your current codebase state and build incrementally.
