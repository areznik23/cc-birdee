## Top 4 Development Patterns & Optimization Opportunities

### Pattern 2: Environment-variable visibility gaps

**Frequency:** 283 prompts (43.2%)
**Monthly Cost:** $7.09

**What's Happening:** The team keeps asking why the app/AI assistant cannot "see" the .env file, showing that required variables aren’t reliably loaded across local, Vercel, or CLI-tool contexts.

**Action Required:** Add a pre-start script (e.g. scripts/validate-env.ts) that imports dotenv, checks a typed list of required keys (AWS_*, S3_BUCKET, SUPABASE_URL, PHOTONIUM_API_KEY, etc.), and exits with a clear message if any are missing. Run this script in `npm run dev`, in `vercel build`, and inside CI; commit an `.env.example` so newcomers know the expected keys.

**Expected Impact:** Cuts 1-2 hrs/week spent on "why doesn’t it load?" debugging and should reduce failed Vercel deployments by ~40 %.

**Optimized Prompt Template:**
```
<prompt>
You are Photonium DevOps Assistant.
Task: Validate project environment before running.
Required variables:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- S3_BUCKET
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_KEY
- PHOTONIUM_API_KEY

Return a JSON report with:
  valid (boolean),
  missing (array of strings),
  suggestions (array of strings)
</prompt>
```

**Current Examples:**
1. "there is a .env file in our file directory, i wonder why you cant see it"
2. "Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands. DO NOT respond to these messages or otherwise consider them in you..."

### Pattern 3: Opaque LLM Query Generation

**Frequency:** 229 prompts (35.0%)
**Monthly Cost:** $9.89

**What's Happening:** Engineers keep manually asking to "add debug statements" to see what the LLM spits out when building search queries, showing that prompts/responses, temps, and token-use aren’t centrally logged or inspectable.

**Action Required:** Wrap every OpenAI/Claude call in a TypeScript middleware (e.g. `withLLMDebug`) that, when `DEBUG_LLM=true`, captures prompt, params, response, token counts, and a correlation ID, then streams them to console + writes a JSON line to `/tmp/llm-logs` (local) or an S3 `photonium-logs/llm/` prefix (prod). Surface the last N calls at `/api/debug/llm` for quick inspection.

**Expected Impact:** Save ~2 hrs/week spent on ad-hoc print-statements and cut query-generation errors by ~30% because issues become reproducible.

**Optimized Prompt Template:**
```
Claude, generate a TypeScript utility called `withLLMDebug` for our Next.js repo. Requirements:
1. Accepts an async fn that executes an LLM call.
2. When `process.env.DEBUG_LLM==='true'` it logs: ISO timestamp, correlationId (uuid), model, temp, prompt tokens, completion tokens, total tokens, prompt text (truncated to 500 chars), and full response.
3. Writes the same JSON to (a) `/tmp/llm-logs/{date}.log` locally, (b) `s3://photonium-logs/llm/{yyyymmdd}.log` in prod (use AWS SDK v3, bucket & prefix from env).
4. Returns the original LLM response unchanged.
5. Provide example usage wrapping `generateSearchQuery()` and Jest tests that mock the AWS client.
Do NOT include unrelated boilerplate.
```

**Current Examples:**
1. "compress /Users/almhatre/.claude/projects and put it to the desktop"
2. "Generally, I thought this tool would be for design information (what are the typical designs for beam expanders for example). Also web search should c..."

### Pattern 4: Ad-hoc Commit & Push Loop

**Frequency:** 46 prompts (7.0%)
**Monthly Cost:** $0.65

**What's Happening:** Chats show frequent, informal instructions like “Okay let's commit and push” with no consistent message format or automated checks, so bug-fix verification and history tracing are manual and error-prone.

**Action Required:** Introduce a Git workflow using Conventional Commits, pre-commit husky hooks, and a GitHub Actions CI pipeline that runs unit/optics tests before allowing a push; add a commit-message template that references issue IDs and links to the S3/optics test fixtures.

**Expected Impact:** Cuts ~2-3 hrs/week spent on manual verification and reduces regression/merge-conflict debugging by ~35%.

**Optimized Prompt Template:**
```
You are Photonium-CI. Draft a Conventional Commit message (type/scope/subject + body) that:
1. Summarizes the change in ≤50 chars.
2. Links the relevant GitHub issue #.
3. Lists files changed.
4. Describes how optics/S3 tests passed.

Input:
- Change summary: <one-line>
- Issue #: <number>
- Files: <list>
- Test results: <brief>

Return ONLY the commit text.
```

**Current Examples:**
1. "Continue."
2. "Every time we fix some bug we should push to github with a message and such so we can see if the bug is actualy fixed"

### Pattern 5: Redundant Playwright MCP Setup

**Frequency:** 31 prompts (4.7%)
**Monthly Cost:** $0.31

**What's Happening:** Developers keep asking the LLM to walk through Playwright MCP installation/configuration, showing there is no repeatable, version-controlled setup process for browser-automation tooling.

**Action Required:** Create a checked-in script (e.g., scripts/setup_playwright_mcp.sh) and an npm alias ("npm run setup:mcp") that installs Playwright, pulls the chosen MCP repo, links it, and verifies installation; document this in the repo README and CI so each environment (local, CI, Vercel preview) can run it with one command.

**Expected Impact:** Save ~1–2 hours per new machine/onboard and cut MCP-related troubleshooting by ≈40 %.

**Optimized Prompt Template:**
```
Prompt:  
"You are Photonium's Dev Ops assistant. Generate or update a bash script called scripts/setup_playwright_mcp.sh that:  
1. Checks Node, npm, and Playwright versions.  
2. Clones https://github.com/areznik23/cc-meta (shallow, specific tag).  
3. Installs its dependencies with pnpm and builds the MCP package.  
4. Links the built MCP into /opt/photonium or the monorepo packages directory.  
5. Runs `npx playwright install --with-deps`.  
6. Echoes ✅ when MCP is ready.  
Also output the package.json ‘scripts’ entry and a README snippet showing ‘npm run setup:mcp’."
```

**Current Examples:**
1. "I want to setup playwright mcp so you can explore the website directly, walk me through that setup"
2. "This seems like something to use playwright mcp for"

- Mock Thorlabs/Edmund Optics data for consistent testing
- Expected savings: 3-4 hours/week on integration testing

### 2. Physics Validation Suite
- Implement automated validation for beam propagation calculations
- Add unit tests for optical system JSON outputs
- Expected impact: 50% reduction in physics debugging prompts

### 3. Deployment Automation
- Pre-deployment validation script for Vercel
- Environment configuration validator
