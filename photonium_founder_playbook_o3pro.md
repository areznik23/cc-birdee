## Top 2 Optical Design Workflows to Templatize (O3-PRO Analysis)

*Copy these templates to build complete features in one Claude Code message*

### Workflow 2: Automated Beam-Expander Designer

**Frequency:** You've built this 390 times
**Time Saved:** 4-6 hours â†’ 20 minutes
**Customer Impact:** Slashes the time needed to research and prototype custom beam expanders, letting Photonium deliver aligned optics for quantum and biotech rigs in a single afternoon instead of days.

**Pattern:** Adam keeps asking for a single â€˜agentâ€™ that, from a short natural-language spec, auto-decides what to web-search, pulls vendor lens data, runs the Gaussian-beam math for a two-lens telescope, and then emits a ready-to-order bill-of-materials in JSON. He wants the whole researchâ†’designâ†’validateâ†’export loop wrapped in one Claude Code prompt so he can drop it into his MVP without extra coding.

**ðŸš€ Complete Claude Code Template:**
```
You are Claude Code. Build a ONE-FILE tool named beam_expander_tool.py that automates the entire beam-expander design workflow.

==== 1. Inputs ====
A single JSON file (or stdin) called design_request.json containing:
{
  "Î»_nm": 780,              # design wavelength in nm
  "M": 5,                   # desired magnification (output/input waist)
  "w_in_mm": 0.5,           # input 1/e^2 waist (mm)
  "max_L_mm": 150,          # max overall length constraint
  "preferred_vendors": ["Thorlabs", "Edmund Optics"],
  "coating": "AR-UV",
  "notes": "diffraction-limited, cage-system compatible"
}

==== 2. Program Requirements ====
1. Parse the JSON spec.
2. Generate 3â€“5 web-search queries that will likely return matching catalog lenses (e.g. "Thorlabs 25 mm focal length UV fused silica lens AR coated").
3. Use Pythonâ€™s requests + BeautifulSoup (or DuckDuckGo HTML results) to pull the first 20 URLs, then scrape tables for: vendor, part number, focal length, diameter, thickness, substrate, price.
4. Build a SQLite in-memory DB of candidate lenses.
5. Enumerate all two-lens Galilean and Keplerian pairs whose focal-length ratio â‰ˆ M Â± 5% and that fit the length constraint (f1 + f2 or |f1| + |f2| + spacing â‰¤ max_L_mm).
6. For each pair, compute:
   â€¢ Exact magnification M_calc
   â€¢ Required spacing L (gaussian propagation)
   â€¢ Output waist w_out
   â€¢ RMS spot size at Î»
7. Rank designs by |M_calc â€“ M|, price, and smallest RMS spot.
8. Return the top 3 designs as JSON:
{
  "designs": [
    {
      "type": "Galilean",
      "M_calc": 4.98,
      "L_mm": 112,
      "components": [
        {"vendor":"Thorlabs","part":"AC254-050-UV","f_mm":50,"price":95},
        {"vendor":"Thorlabs","part":"AC254-250-UV","f_mm":250,"price":112}
      ],
      "total_price":207,
      "cad_urls":["https://...step","https://...step"],
      "alignment_notes":"Place convex lens first â€¦"
    },
    â€¦
  ]
}
9. Write that JSON to beam_expander_output.json and pretty-print to stdout.
10. Provide a function export_to_unity() that converts the design to a .fbx with correct lens spacing (use simplescene or placeholder boxes) so Adam can drop it into Unity.

==== 3. End-to-End Test ====
If run as __main__, load tests/example_request.json, run the pipeline, assert that at least one design is returned and that magnification error <5 %.

==== 4. Usage ====
> python beam_expander_tool.py design_request.json

==== 5. Deliverable ====
Return ONLY the full Python file contents between triple backticks so Adam can copy-paste it. Include:
â€¢ imports
â€¢ helper funcs (search_web, scrape_page, build_db)
â€¢ gaussian_beam functions
â€¢ design_picker()
â€¢ export_to_unity()
â€¢ main guard + test

BEGIN CODE
```

### Workflow 3: Automated Fiber-Coupler Designer

**Frequency:** You've built this 221 times
**Time Saved:** 5-7 hours â†’ 20 minutes
**Customer Impact:** Quantum and biotech teams receive a ready-to-assemble, tolerance-checked fiber coupling module in minutes, accelerating prototype iterations and freeing Adam to focus on higher-value features.

**Pattern:** Adam repeatedly wants to go from high-level coupling specs (wavelength, beam waist, target fiber) to a complete, validated lens + mount solution. The sequence always follows: search vendor catalogs â†’ run Gaussian-beam calculations for optimal mode-matching â†’ sanity-check performance with tolerance sweeps â†’ emit a structured JSON BOM and placement diagram, ready for CAD import.

### PHOTONIUM FIBER-COUPLER DESIGNER (single-prompt, end-to-end)
# Fill everything between <user-input> tags, then send the whole prompt to Claude Code.

<user-input>
TARGET_WAVELENGTH_NM = 780            # e.g. 780, 850, 1064
INPUT_BEAM_WAIST_MM = 0.75            # 1/e^2 radius of incident Gaussian
FIBER_MODEL = "SM780"                 # any standard catalog part number
COUPLING_EFFICIENCY_GOAL = 0.90        # fraction of power into fiber
MECHANICAL_CONSTRAINTS = "30 cm max optical length, 25 mm cage system preferred"
OPERATING_ENVIRONMENT = "lab"          # lab / field / vacuum / cleanroom
SPECIAL_NOTES = "minimize chromatic shift; budget <$800"
</user-input>

INSTRUCTIONS TO CLAUDE CODE (execute internally, return ONE final JSON block):
1. Research â†’ Query Thorlabs & Edmund Optics APIs for lenses, fiber collimators, and compatible mounts that match TARGET_WAVELENGTH_NM and budget. Rank by coating, focal length, diameter, cost.
2. Design â†’
   a. Treat INPUT_BEAM_WAIST_MM as w0 at z=0.
   b. Compute ideal lens focal length(s) and spacing that mode-match to the chosen FIBER_MODELâ€™s mode-field diameter & NA.
   c. If a single lens cannot reach COUPLING_EFFICIENCY_GOAL, explore two-lens telescope solutions.
3. Validate â†’ Perform Gaussian-beam propagation and overlap-integral calculation to estimate coupling efficiency. Run Â±5% focal-length and Â±100 Âµm positioning tolerance sweep; report worst-case efficiency.
4. Generate â†’ Output a JSON object with:
   {
     "bill_of_materials": [ {"part_number", "vendor", "description", "price_usd"}, â€¦ ],
     "optical_layout": [ {"component", "z_mm", "x_mm", "y_mm", "orientation"}, â€¦ ],
     "expected_efficiency": {"nominal", "worst_case"},
     "assembly_instructions": "step-by-step text",
     "cad_export": "solidworks_pack_and_go.zip (base64) OR null if not requested"
   }
5. End-to-End Test â†’ Insert an internal unit test that re-computes overlap integral using the returned layout; assert |Î·_test âˆ’ Î·_nominal| < 1e-3. If it fails, iterate component choice automatically once.
6. Finish â†’ Return ONLY the final JSON. No explanations. Ensure it is valid JSON.

# After sending, wait for Claude Code to reply with the complete JSON design package.
